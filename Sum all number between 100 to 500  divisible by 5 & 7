##Write a Python function to find the sum of all numbes between 100 to 500 which are divisible by 5 and 7
def sum_divisible_by_5_and_7(start, end):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        if num % 5 == 0 and num % 7 == 0:
            total_sum += num
    return total_sum

# Example usage:
start_range = 100
end_range = 500
result = sum_divisible_by_5_and_7(start_range, end_range)
print("Sum of numbers between 100 and 500 divisible by both 5 and 7:", result)
