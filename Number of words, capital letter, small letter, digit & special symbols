##Write a program that takes in a sentence as input and displays the number of words, number of capital letters, number of small letters, number of digit and number of special symbols
def count_characters(sentence):
    num_words = len(sentence.split())
    num_uppercase = sum(1 for char in sentence if char.isupper())
    num_lowercase = sum(1 for char in sentence if char.islower())
    num_digits = sum(1 for char in sentence if char.isdigit())
    num_special_symbols = sum(1 for char in sentence if not char.isalnum())

    return num_words, num_uppercase, num_lowercase, num_digits, num_special_symbols

# Example usage:
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
num_words, num_uppercase, num_lowercase, num_digits, num_special_symbols = count_characters(sentence)

print("Number of words:", num_words)
print("Number of uppercase letters:", num_uppercase)
print("Number of lowercase letters:", num_lowercase)
print("Number of digits:", num_digits)
print("Number of special symbols:", num_special_symbols)
